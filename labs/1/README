Matlab code is contained in the `code` directory. To run a simulation
using an EKF, use the `runlocalisation_track` function. Examples of
the parameters to the function can be found in `init.m`, along with
various initialisation parameters. To use different maps, you should
uncomment the relevant parts of the file, which contain the process
and measurement noise models. The `kf_car` function is a simple
simulation of a car using a kalman filter to estimate its position.

The top level directory contains a report with answers to questions
regarding the workings of the KF and EKF and some simple
explanation of the plots that result from the simulation.
